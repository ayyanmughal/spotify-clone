# spotify-clone
Developed a responsive, single-page clone of the Spotify user interface using pure HTML5 and CSS3. This project demonstrates a strong command of front-end fundamentals by meticulously recreating the platform's complex layout and design. Key skills demonstrated include semantic HTML structure and advanced CSS techniques, such as Flexbox and CSS Grid, to achieve a pixel-perfect, static representation of the popular music streaming service.
